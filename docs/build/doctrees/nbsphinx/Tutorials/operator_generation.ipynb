    "The physical modes can still be addressed individually when defining site operators and Hamiltonians. Essentially, nothing changes between using mode combination and not using it when building the Hamiltonian or any other operator. The advantage is that, by using a reduced number of modes in the tensor network, the entanglement between subsystems (i.e. between the composite modes) is described more efficiently.\n",

    "The example below shows a list of dimensions corresponding to 10 physical modes. They are easily combined into composite modes using nested lists. The modes that are combined have to be adjacent: only modes next to each other in the network can form a composite mode—this is to avoid closed loops in the network topology."
